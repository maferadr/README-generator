# README Generator
    by Maria Angulo

   As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications, through which many connections can be handled concurrently, allowing the user to request different callback functions symultanously and work locally without depending necessarily on the browser. 

   Developers most of the times will be required to build BackEnd applications and contained professional README files that will work as their cover to better describe their knowledge. Above, there's a README file generated by Node and the terminal by answeing the prompts printed in the console.
