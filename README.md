# README Generator
    by Maria Angulo

    As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications, 
    through which many connections can be handled concurrently, allowing the user to request different callback functions 
    symultanously and work locally without depending necessarily on the browser.

    Developers most of the times will be required to build BackEnd applications and contained professional README files that 
    will work as their cover to better describe their knowledge. Above, there's a README file generated by Node and the terminal 
    by answeing the prompts printed in the console.
